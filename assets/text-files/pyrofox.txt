Supporting the likes of The Darkness and Eagles of Death Metal. 
PYROFOX are a hard-hitting 4-piece heavy rock band from Bournemouth on the south coast of the UK. 
PYROFOX are now launching into the British alternative rock music scene, in full force with their brand new single ANIMAL.
Immediately evident is the powerhouse that is lead vocalist Tegen Jones, with her very infectious raspy vocals easily mistaken for Lzzy Hale from Halestorm. Oh my do these pack a hell of a punch!
Throughout this catchy, hard-hitting track their is a wild combination of guitar riffs, drum beats and punchy bass lines which gets the heart racing, the blood pumping and just wants you to get up, and start that mosh pit up!
Itâ€™s definitely one of those tracks you will keep listening to and I cannot wait to hear more from these guys and see them out on more UK tours in the near future.
PYROFOX are here!
