Ilmarinen - Gold 

Gold comes galloping in like a demented carousel horse at a victorian carnival. Guns ablaze with its devilish fiddle and air punching guitar chords, this song makes me feel like I’ve had a double espresso. Lyrically and musically, this track makes one thing clear -  Ilmarinen are here to take heads. The momentum gathered from this jolly roller coaster through hell continues seamlessly into the 2nd and final track- Bier Drinken en Kut Roepen. It’s hard to resist a foolish grin listening to these scary, axe-wielding dutch forest dwellers sing about such a relatable subject as losing ones beer. I’ll bet my bottom dollar, however, that the beer in their neck of the woods Isn’t so overpriced and likely flat. This one-two punch release by Ilmarinen will make even the stuffiest of music fans want to go out and wrestle a bear!
